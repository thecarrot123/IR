# Lab 9

## Overview

The focus is on how trees can be used to index vector data. The notebook generates a dataset of 2D points that are uniformly distributed in a square and visualizes them in a plot. Creates KDTree, BallTree, VPTree, and Annoy and compares their performance in terms of time and recall. Finally, analyzes the graphs and discusses which data structure is best suited for various tasks.
